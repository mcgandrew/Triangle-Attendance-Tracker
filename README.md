# Triangle-Attendance-Tracker
A mobile app to track attendance for WSU Triangle events.

From the user perspective, sign up for an account. Wait for the account to be accepted into Triangle, and then the only function of the app is to scan a QR code that will mark your attendance. So let's say a member shows up at chapter, whips out their phone, scans the code, and then they are marked for attendance.

From the admin perspective, you are able to make "events" (recurring ones like chapter let's say), and then see the attendance for them.
